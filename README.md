[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/i-lateral/silverstripe-users/badges/quality-score.png?b=1)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/i-lateral/silverstripe-users/?branch=1)

Basic user account management, signin and registration module designed
to be used with pure silverstripe framework (no CMS)

This module is intended to provide a very bare bones profile management
system that can be easily expanded using extension classes and templates
to allow users to build profile editing into any system they want to
use.

## Installation

```
composer require i-lateral/silverstripe-users
```
